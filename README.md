# Covid-19-data-analysis-for-India
The goal of this project is to show that I can collect, manipulate, clean, and analyse a data set. For this project I have downloaded the world's covid-19 data from 30-01-2020 to 11-12-2021. Then, after cleaning and extracting the India's data I have analyzed the India's situation and performance during the 1st and 2nd wave of covid-19. 

I have investigated different questions -
1. India’s performance in handling covid-19 during this period?
2. Spread rate of covid-19 in India?
3. Death-rate?
4. Effect of lockdown in India? In terms of Death-rate, Recovery-rate, New-cases.

• This project is completed with the help of pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn package installed on Python 3.8 and PyCharm IDE. • Please see the details in Conclusion.pdf for the better understanding analysis report and covidDataAnalysis.py for the batter understanding of the code.
